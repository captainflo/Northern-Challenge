When submitting the form:
- If the email field does not validate, an error message should be rendered.
- If the email field is valid, the form should submit and log the value of each field in the browser console without refreshing the page.

- It should allow only a single submission. That is, subsequent attempts to submit should be ignored after the initial submission.
- After the simulated request, a “thank you” message should replace the form without refreshing the page.
